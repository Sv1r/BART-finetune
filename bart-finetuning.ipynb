When a fine is suspended, in whole or in part, the state penalty shall be reduced in proportion to the suspension.\n(c) When any deposited bail is made for an offense to which this section applies, and for which a court appearance is not mandatory, the person making the deposit shall also deposit a sufficient amount to include the state penalty prescribed by this section for forfeited bail. If bail is returned, the state penalty paid thereon pursuant to this section shall also be returned.\n(d) In any case where a person convicted of any offense, to which this section applies, is in prison until the fine is satisfied, the judge may waive all or any part of the state penalty, the payment of which would work a hardship on the person convicted or his or her immediate family.\n(e) After a determination by the court of the amount due, the clerk of the court shall collect the penalty and transmit it to the county treasury. The portion thereof attributable to Chapter 12 (commencing with Section 76000) of Title 8 of the Government Code shall be deposited in the appropriate county fund and 70 percent of the balance shall then be transmitted to the State Treasury, to be deposited in the State Penalty Fund, which is hereby created, and 30 percent to remain on deposit in the county general fund. The transmission to the State Treasury shall be carried out in the same manner as fines collected for the state by a county.\n(f) The moneys so deposited in the State Penalty Fund shall be distributed as follows:\n(1) Once a month there shall be transferred into the Fish and Game Preservation Fund an amount equal to 0.33 percent of the state penalty funds deposited in the State Penalty Fund during the preceding month, except that the total amount shall not be less than the state penalty levied on fines or forfeitures for violation of state laws relating to the protection or propagation of fish and game.

Money in the Corrections Training Fund is not continuously appropriated and shall be appropriated in the Budget Act.\n(6) Once a month there shall be transferred into the Local Public Prosecutors and Public Defenders Training Fund established pursuant to Section 11503 an amount equal to 0.78 percent of the state penalty funds deposited in the State Penalty Fund during the preceding month. The amount so transferred shall not exceed the sum of eight hundred fifty thousand dollars ($850,000) in any fiscal year. The remainder in excess of eight hundred fifty thousand dollars ($850,000) shall be transferred to the Restitution Fund.\n(7) Once a month there shall be transferred into the Victim-Witness Assistance Fund an amount equal to 8.64 percent of the state penalty funds deposited in the State Penalty Fund during the preceding month.\n(8) (A) Once a month there shall be transferred into the Traumatic Brain Injury Fund, created pursuant to Section 4358 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, an amount equal to 0.66 percent of the state penalty funds deposited into the State Penalty Fund during the preceding month. However, the amount of funds transferred into the Traumatic Brain Injury Fund for the 1996–97 fiscal year shall not exceed the amount of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000).

Notwithstanding Section 13340 of the Government Code, all moneys in the fund are continuously appropriated to the Board of State and Community Corrections for the purposes of Section 14400.\n14404.\nIf federal funds become available for the purpose of purchasing body-worn cameras and related equipment for local law enforcement, the Board of State and Community Corrections shall adjust the grant program to maximize state and local competitiveness in obtaining federal funds, and the board shall either apply for federal funds on behalf of a local law enforcement agency, or reimburse a local law enforcement agency that has expended funds for federal funds purposes.\nSECTION 1.\nSection 566 of the\nPenal Code\nis amended to read:\n566.\nIt is a felony, punishable by a fine not exceeding one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500), or by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170, or both, for an unauthorized person to possess or use, or to obliterate or destroy the brand registration upon, containers, including milk cases, cabinets, or other dairy equipment, which have a value in excess of nine hundred fifty dollars ($950), when the containers, cabinets, or other dairy equipment are marked with a brand that is registered pursuant to Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 34501) of Part 1 of Division 15 of the Food and Agricultural Code.
